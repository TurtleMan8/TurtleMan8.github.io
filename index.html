        <span class="comment">Brilliant character study. One of my favourite duos in film. Awesome dialogue. Incredible subtle buildups with payoffs that vary in intensity, but are consistently exceptional.</span>

        <span class="comment">The best war story. Gritty and real, more so than the others of it's kind. Characters are presented warts and all, it's so easy to feel what they're feeling. Beautifully directed.</span>

        <span class="comment">Eccentric. Atmospheric through it's cinematography and use of sound. Haunting in a kind of awful, gruesome way. Love it.</span>

        <span class="rightcolumn">I love dialogue, and this is 95% just fantastic dialogue. Awesome flow in editing (especially the pacing of each shot/cut), with some great performances to go along with it. Amplified by some super interesting use of sound design and soundtracks to make a captivating experience overall.</span>

        <img src="assets/Espanol_3584-1-.webp" alt="The Dark Knight">
        <span class="comment">As tightly written as stories can get. Heath Ledger and the Joker are stunning. Use of colour and sound is awesome, and one of Chris Nolan's best accomplishments in directing.</span>

        <span class="comment">What can you say. Maybe the best character dynamic ever in it's main duo, consistently thrilling and dramatic, with some of the most cathartic climaxes.</span>
      </div>  
      <div class="story">
        <img src="assets/s-l1200-1.webp" alt="Better Call Saul">
        <span class="comment">Shockingly good, not as a prequel to Breaking Bad (although it's of course great in that way too), but as it's own story about completely different people. Starts out intruguing and just continues to improve through it's runtime. Perfect composition. As good as characters get.</span>

        <img src="assets/p19500_v_v8_ay.jpg" alt="12 Angry Men">
        <span class="rightcolumn">A premise that doesn't seem like it could ever be so good. Draws you in slowly and keeps you there forever. An accomplishment in cinematography and dialogue.</span>

        <span class="comment">A decent movie until the last quarter or so. The climax is what made this film so great for me. Perfect character moment with awesome directing to conclude that leaves you completely dumbstruck.</span>

        <span class="comment">A bunch of classic stories and cliches subtly subverted to create a twisted, beautiful, stunning tale. Pretty much the best animation, sound, and music gets, elevating it's characters by so so much.</span>
      </div>

        <span class="rightcolumn">Stylish. Awesome vibes, classic Fincher flow through the whole thing. Brad Pitt and Edward Norton were perfect.</span>

        <span class="comment">Legendary and for good reason. Kind of an unbeatable series of films in a way (original trilogy). Just a great, complete, tightly written saga.</span>

      <div class="story">
        <img src="assets/s-l1600.jpg" alt="The Bear">
        <span class="comment">Fast-paced to a super stressful degree, which elevates the moments where this show takes it time so much. Episodes fly by. Characters are great, but the direction and editing is what makes this show really shine.</span>

      <div class="story">
        <img src="assets/99X2SgyFunJFXGAYnDv3sb9pnUD.webp" alt="The Usual Suspects">
        <span class="comment">So so intelligent. Presentation is perfect, paried with a brilliant premise and wonderful execution.</span>

        <img src="assets/s-l1600-1.jpg" alt="Forrest Gump">
        <span class="rightcolumn">Hits you really hard without you realizing. The weight of such a goofy film really sneaks up you, messing with your emotions afterwards.</span>

        <img src="assets/Berserk_vol01.png" alt="Berserk">
        <span class="comment">My absolute greatest. Takes you on a journey that you can never come back from. The best protagonist-antagonist pair ever, with the most complete side cast to accompany them. Art is as good as it gets, amplifying everything. Extreme constrast between intensity and beautiful eloquence. I cannot believe this exists.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="story">
        <img src="assets/Volume_1.webp" alt="Haikyuu">
        <span class="comment">Top 1 sports story. Characters and their dynamics, hype, subtly important lessons, conflicting mindsets, theres no end to how much value this manga holds. Full of soul.</span>

        <span class="comment">Delves extremely deep (sometimes uncomfortably so) into it's characters psychology. Presents every side of humanity with no holds barred.</span>

        <span class="rightcolumn">A sobering tale. Comfortable, melancholic, and strangely magical and profound in many moments. My favourite ending of all time.</span>

        <img src="assets/71TY7kJBo9L._AC_UF1000,1000_QL80_.jpg" alt="Vagabond">
        <span class="comment">Wonderful manga. Musashi is perfect, and the progression he goes through is maybe the best I've experienced. The artwork is stunning. A very real art style, and a consistently high level of quality was achieved throughout the entire manga.</span>

        <span class="comment">Pure chaotic fun. Love them all. Smart in it's planning and adaptation of the source. Makes a complex story accessible.</span>

        <img src="assets/Attack_on_Titan_Season_1.webp" alt="Attack on Titan">
        <span class="comment">Probably the best "HOLY CRAP" moments I've ever experienced ever, and the progression of this series is seriously incredible. The way the world and characters develop is kind of unmatched, with the scope of this series becoming larger and larger. The developments are something I would never have seen coming, yet simultaneously it feels like the only direction the story could ever go in.</span>

        <img src="assets/2547312-01_cropped.jpg" alt="Great Teacher Onizuka">
        <span class="rightcolumn">Unabashed in a perfect way. The best at teaching it's audience. Such real characters. Onizuka is the greatest.</span>

        <img src="assets/Bakemonogatari_Poster.webp" alt="The Monogatari Series">
        <span class="comment">A masterclass in character writing. Dramatic and flexible in it's presentation. Brilliant sound and the best editing in the medium. About as good as character dynamics get. Problematic</span>

      <div class="story">
        <img src="assets/MV5BMzcyZDQ1YTEtOWE5Ni00NjQ5LWJmYWYtMTY0NGNlMTc2MzM2XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMjI5MjU5OTI@._V1_.jpg" alt="Run With the Wind">

        <span class="rightcolumn">Maybe my favourite comedy ever. Bursting with charm and a joy to keep up with weekly. Seriously powerful emotional moments here too, though. Some of the best character dynamics in the medium.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="story">
        <img src="assets/ems.jpg" alt="Your Name">
        <span class="comment">Leaves you speechless. The PAYOFFS. Twilight, all the throwaway lines and little actions, everything comes together so beautifully by the end. Cultural relevance, visual and audio motifs, musubi, so much unbelievable stuff.</span>

        <span class="comment"> Incredibly intricate and well planned out narrative.  The start is generally seen as slow and possibly boring, but it's definitely necessary as buildup and to thoroughly introduce the characters. Haunting.</span>
      </div>

        <span class="comment">Arcs have incredible variety in tone and content. Consistently imaginative. Nen is the best power system.</span>
